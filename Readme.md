# Disassembling a Monolith with Node.js

**The Rationale Behind This Presentation**

Traditional full-stack web frameworks (Laravel, Django, Rails and others) all adhere to a set of conventions that improve your workflow and productivity for certain tasks.

For a variety of reasons, most of which will not be discussed here, developers are willing to accept the limitations of these tools. It's a tradeoff between flexibility and development speed, and while frameworks will always force us to choose what's most important, what if we could build our application with smaller, more agile tools that reduced the impact of our choice?

What if you could build an application in many tiny pieces, where pieces of your architecture could be swapped out at a moment's notice? How would your team react if they were no longer tied to a single framework, and were instead empowered to use the best tool for the job at hand?

Presented here in the repo are several code examples that back up my Nodevember talk on this subject. Read through them, and feel free to ask any questions
